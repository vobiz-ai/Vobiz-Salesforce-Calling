 * It stays registered over SIP for as long as the panel is open, starts a call
 * when an agent clicks a phone number anywhere in the CRM (Freshworks CRM emits
 * `calling`, where Freshdesk emitted `cti.triggerDialer`), and writes a call log
 * against the matching contact when the call ends.
 *
 * Every value this app needs is an installation parameter — see
 * config/iparams.json. Nothing about a particular account is compiled in.
 *
 * This app is a client. It cannot place a call on its own: it talks to a
 * calling backend that holds the Vobiz account credentials and drives the
 * Vobiz REST API. That contract is documented in docs/backend-contract.md.

 * Freshsales call logging

 *
 *   - The endpoint is /crm/sales/api/phone_calls. Freshworks' own CTI codelab
 *     names /crm/sales/api/cti_phone_calls, which answers 400 to every shape.
 *   - The body is multipart/form-data with phone_call[...] bracket keys. JSON
 *     is accepted for scalars but silently drops targetable and errors on note.
 *   - call_direction is a BOOLEAN, not a string: true sets status "incoming",
 *     false sets "outgoing". Sending the word "incoming" stores false.
 *   - targetable needs BOTH targetable_type and targetable[id]. Sending a
 *     targetable object instead raises a server-side Ruby error.
 *   - A note has to be nested as note[description]. Plain note= or
 *     description= are ignored, and note= as a string raises a server error.
 *
 * Not solved: attaching the recording as playable audio. `recording`,
 * `recording_url` and `external_recording_url` are all ignored and the record's
 * own is_external_recording_url flag never leaves false. The link is put in the
 * note instead, which is at least reachable from the contact.

/**
 * Place an outbound call with this browser as the A leg.
 *
 * The obvious design — and what docs/backend-contract.md describes — is to have
 * the backend originate to the customer over the REST API and then bridge this
 * browser in with <Dial><User>. That path is dead: routing *into* a registered
 * WebRTC endpoint is broken platform-side. Vobiz builds an unparseable gateway
 * URI for the B leg and drops its own INVITE:
 *
 *   ERROR: tr_eval_uri(): invalid uri [user@…-webrtc-3.vobiz.ai:7032;…]
 *   INVITE|blocking gw: …
 *
 * 510 of those in 14 days, across other accounts and Vobiz's own SDK. The caller
 * hears ringback and nothing else, and the dial result reads ring=true with an
 * empty DialBLegUUID.
 *
 * Dialling *out* of a registered endpoint works fine, so this sends the INVITE
 * from here instead. Vobiz then fetches the endpoint application's answer URL,
 * and the backend replies with <Dial><Number> to reach the customer — the same
 * shape Vobiz's own rtc-demo and WebRTC playground use.
